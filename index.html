            <h3> Introduction: </h3>
            <p> 
                Hi, I'm Michelle, an incoming fourth-year student at the University of California San Diego majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. I am passionate 
                about building intelligent software solutions and have gained hands-on experience in software development and machine learning throughout my time in college. In the future, 
                I hope to contribute to innovative technologies that harness the power of AI and machine learning to improve people’s lives and create meaningful impact in the world. My strongest 
                skills include programming in Java, Python, C++, and C; front-end development using React (JavaScript), CSS, and Figma; and applying prompt engineering techniques, data structures, 
                and algorithms to develop efficient and intelligent systems.
            </p>
